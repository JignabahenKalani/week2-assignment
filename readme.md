# Smile NGO - Responsive Multi-Page Website

This is the Smile NGO Website, a fully responsive, multi-page web project built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, leveraging modern techniques such as **Flexbox**, **CSS variables**, **pseudo-classes**, and **semantic HTML**.

- This site was created as part of a web development challenge to reinforce real-world frontend skills while simulating a real client project for a nonprofit organization.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✅ Responsive Layout with Flexbox

- Fully responsive across **mobile**, **tablet**, and **desktop**.
- Flexbox used for layout structure (header, nav, grid sections, footer).
- Items aligned using `justify-content`, `align-items`, and wrapping techniques.

### ✅ Modern CSS Practices

- **CSS Variables**: Colors, spacing, borders, and font settings are all centralized via `:root` for easy theming and consistency.

- **Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements**:
  - Navigation links use `:hover` and `::after` for smooth underline animation.
  - Boxes and buttons use `:hover` for interactivity.

- Separated CSS file (`style.css`).

### ✅ Multi-Page Navigation

The site includes the following pages:

| Page             | Description                                                |
